This repository contains an implementation of the U-Net architecture using PyTorch. The implementation consists of the U_NET class, which inherits from the nn.Module class provided by PyTorch. Within the U_NET class, the encoder (contraction) and decoder (expansion) paths are defined using convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and transpose convolutional layers. The forward method specifies how input data is processed through the network, first passing through the encoder path and then through the decoder path. The model also includes methods for repeated convolution operations and cropping of feature maps.
